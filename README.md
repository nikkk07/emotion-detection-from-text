🧠 Emotion Detection from Text – NLP Project

This project focuses on detecting human emotions from raw textual input using a combination of classical NLP techniques and transformer-based models. The solution is implemented in Python on Google Colab, utilizing libraries such as transformers, nltk, and textblob.

🔍 Features

Accepts free-form user input text
Performs sentiment and polarity analysis
Maps detected sentiment to emotional categories (e.g., Joy, Sadness, Anger, Neutral)
Uses pretrained models from HuggingFace for enhanced accuracy
Fast, reliable, and scalable via cloud-based execution


🛠️ Technologies Used
